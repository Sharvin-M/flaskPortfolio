                How do different factors contribute to a student's performance
                on an exam?
              </h2>
              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
                I used a dataset showcasing different factors and their relation
                to a students performance on 3 sections of an exam(reading,
                writing, and math). The research framework I developed focused
                on answering the overarching question: What factor from the
                dataset has the greatest impact on a students performance in any
                given section of the exam. To do so, I formed groups using the
                different factors and scores from the exams and compared them to
                find which had the highest correlation. The results of my study
                concluded that parental level of education was the factor that
                most greatly affected the performance of a given student on all
                3 portions of an exam.

                The objective of the project was to make an interactive map that
                displays the health history of restaurants in the Dublin
                California region. During the project I was responsible for
                helping my team develop the front-end aspect of the website. I
                was also responsible for the development of the back-end
                databases. Additionally, I contributed to the documentation and
                design processes.
